Dollar Amounts:\n- No specific dollar amounts are stated; TFP cost adjustments are tied to CPI-U and geographic cost differences.\n\n3. Downstream Effects:\n- Freezes the real value of SNAP benefits by prohibiting cost increases from future TFP re-evaluations.\n- Limits USDA discretion in adjusting SNAP benefit levels, reducing potential for benefit increases based on updated dietary guidance or food cost data.\n- Codifies a fixed formula for household size adjustments, standardizing benefit scaling across household types.\n- May reduce future SNAP spending growth relative to current law by constraining TFP updates."

  "overall_analysis": "1. **Strategic Retrenchment from Climate and Clean Energy**: The budget rescinds unobligated balances from major climate laws (IRA, CHIPS), phases out clean energy tax credits, and restricts foreign participation, signaling a national policy shift away from decarbonization and reducing long-term federal climate expenditures.\n\n2. **Defense, Agriculture, and Capital Investment Expansion**: Significant increases in defense and agriculture spending are paired with structural baseline adjustments and enforcement exemptions, while over $70B is allocated for long-term capital and workforce investments in immigration, education, and justice, embedding durable federal commitments.\n\n3. **Tax Code Changes with Structural Revenue Decline**: Permanent extension of TCJA provisions and new tax-advantaged savings vehicles reduce federal revenues beyond FY2028, with partial offsets creating future fiscal cliffs and increasing long-term budgetary pressure.\n\n4. **Administrative and Compliance Burden Growth**: Expanded eligibility definitions, new reporting mandates, and increased oversight authority across IRS, CMS, DOJ, and DHS raise federal and state administrative costs and necessitate expanded staffing and interagency coordination.\n\n5. **Regressive Fiscal Structure with Targeted Equity Measures**: The shift to fee-based funding and narrowed aid eligibility imposes disproportionate burdens on low-income populations, while selective investments in rural health, underserved communities, and environmental justice (e.g., RECA) provide limited compensatory equity interventions."
